GRCh38 GENOME MASKS
====================

This directory contains GRCh38 genomic masks that help identify regions of the genome
that are more or less accessible to next generation sequencing methods using
short reads.

Each mask is summarized in a fasta file (one fasta file per chromosome), coded
as follows:

N - the base is an N in the reference genome GRCh37
L - depth of coverage is much lower than average
H - depth of coverage is much higher than average
Z - too many reads with zero mapping quality overlap this position
Q - the average mapping quality at the position is too low
P - the base passed all filters
0 - an overlapping base was never observed in aligned reads

Regions marked as L, H, Z or Q are less accessible to short reads. Although
they can still be analyzed they are more prone to false positives. 

The calculation of accessibility is based on the alignment of whole genome low coverage
data of 2691 phase3 samples to GRCh38.

The masks are useful for (a) comparing accessibility using current technologies
to accessibility in the pilot project, and (b) population genetic analysis (such
as estimates of mutation rate) that must focus on genomic regions with very
low false positive and false negative rates.

PilotMask DIRECTORY
===================

The PilotMask directory uses the same mask definition used in the 1000 Genomes
Project Pilot Paper (Nature, 2010). This definition excludes the portion of the
genome where depth of coverage (summed across all samples) was higher or lower
than the average depth by a factor of 2-fold. It also excludes sites where 
>20% of overlapping reads had mapping quality of zero.

The average total depth of coverage across Phase 3 samples on GRCh38 is 20360. Thus, sites
with a depth of coverage of <10180 or >40720 were excluded. 

Overall, this mask results in 5.3% of bases marked N, 1.4% marked
L, 0.6% marked H and 3.7% marked Z. The remaining 89.0% of passed are marked 
passed (P) - and correspond to 94.0% of non-N bases.

In addition to masked fasta files, a bed file of all passed sites can be found in this directory.

StrictMask DIRECTORY
====================

The StrictMask directory uses a more stringent definition. This definition uses
a narrower band for coverage, requiring that total coverage should be within 50%
of the average, that no more than 0.1% of reads have mapping quality of zero, 
and that the average mapping quality for the position should be 56 or greater.

This definition is quite stringent and focuses on the most unique regions of the 
genome.

The average total depth of coverage across Phase 3 samples is 20360. Thus, sites
with a depth of coverage of <10180 or >30540 were excluded.

Overall, this strict mask results in about 5.3% of bases marked N, 1.4% marked
L, 1.0% marked H, 18.1% marked Z, and 0% marked Q. The remaining 74.1% of
passed are marked passed (P) - corresponding to 78.2% of the non-N bases.

In addition to masked fasta files, a bed file of all passed sites can be found in this directory.
