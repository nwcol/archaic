I misparameterized a few things here:

(1) I intended that the ancestral Ne be fixed at ~11000, but accidentally fit it while leaving post-stem-split N1 fixed at 8000. 
(2) I meant that the transition between these epochs should be the same as the stem 2 start time 
(3) Less significant; some bound adjustment may be necessary especially for Khomani-San start time
