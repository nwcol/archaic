15-01-2024 Monday: approx 10am-2pm (sporadically throughout the day)
	- Setup on new debian install
	- Cloned github repository 'archaic' locally and copied the data folder into it
	- Rearranged the data folder and deleted some deprecated merged chromosomes etc
	- Created a personal github token and figured out how to use it to push local changes onto github
	- Installed pip, venv
	- Set up virtual environment- msprime installed without issue- and used pip freeze to recreate an accurate requirements.txt file
	- Updated .gitignore and specifically excluded directories in data/
	- Installed and configured pycharm
	- Tested some python files and corrected file paths to the Linux hierarchy a little
	- Tested out bcftools and confirmed that it's working
	
To-do:
	- I need to get bgzip set up
	- Tomorrow I will do some productive work and start attacking the problem of efficiently computing joint heteterozygosity
	
	
16-01-2024 Tuesday: No serious work. Distracted.
	- Spent some time learning C

To-do:
	- Above. 
	

17-01-2024 Wednesday: 11am-12:30pm and 2:30pm-4:30pm
	- Deleted old analysis module; obselete because it operated on .txt files with stats in them, which I no longer use
	- Spent some time screwing around with imports to iron out an elegant way to handle them. Sample in terminal:
		>>> import sys
		>>> sys.path.append("/home/nick/Projects/archaic/src")
		>>> import archaic.bed_util as bed_util
	- Started seriously working on joint het computation
	
To-do:
	- Joint het!


18-01-2024 Thursday: 9:30am-12:30pm, 1:30pm-2pm
	- Created a new file (maybe temporary) called joint_het.py
	- Wasted a lot of time trying to find efficient ways of computing joint het with matrices
	- Experimented with computing two sample joint het
	- Wrote a function (which I have called "idea()" for the present) which computes two-sample joint het across an entire chromosome in about 35s for 90,000 alts in 19 Mb
		- No bins yet
		- Operates explictly on only those sites which have >= 1 variant across samples
		- It seems to be safe to ignore all sites which lack alternate alleles in the computation, as any site pair with 0/0 at at least one site in every sample will always give a joint het. of zero
	
To-do:
	- Understand and maybe improve the r-binning method that I previously used for single-sample joint het
	- Implement r binning in the two-sample computation
	- Clean things up and figure out how I want to conduct analysis in the future (in IDE? from terminal? lots of python or shell scripts or not?)
	- Tidy up and improve the vcf_samples class, which is highly useful but could be further refined
	- Docstrings, function and variable names




22-01-2024 Monday: 2pm-4pm
	- Added a means of organizing alternate alleles by r-bin to joint_het.py
	- Implemented binning into "idea()" and renamed it "main()" in joint_het.py
	- Wrote a function called naive() to compute joint het by directly looping over all variant pairs; as I might have expected, it was impractically slow (taking potentially many hours to execute)
	- Ended up rewriting the joint het. function completely and testing it on a few samples, for chromosomes 22 and 13
		- Chromosome 22 returned strange results and took under 50 seconds
		- Chromosome 13 has close to 3 times as many variant sites and took close to 500 seconds; these results conformed slightly better to expectation but still appeared very noisy.
