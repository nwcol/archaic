01-17-2024 Wednesday: 11am-12:40pm
	- Deleted old analysis module; obselete because it operated on .txt files with stats in them, which I no longer use
	- Spent some time screwing around with imports to iron out an elegant way to handle them. Sample:
		>>> import sys
		>>> sys.path.append("/home/nick/Projects/archaic/src")
		>>> import archaic.bed_util as bed_util
