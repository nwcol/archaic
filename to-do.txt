primary goals

questions that can be asked about inference fxns:
    to what extent does convergence go to the same spot under the same intial parameters and other specifications?
    to what extent does optimization routine choice influence
        the speed of convergence
        the spot at which convergence occurs
    with different initial parameters, do we tend to converge to the same spot or to various local maxima?


- really work out the plot functions/scripts and get automated plotting down nicely

- make functions more verbose and nicer

- build a library of pre-parsed map/etc combinations!

- learn about expectations of H2 and write methods to compute it analytically

- learn about the relationship between LD, H2! Review definitions of statistics that measure LD

- Understand the two locus recursion system

=> check the optimization approximation stuff and make sure it runs properly. clean up this file

- decide what to do with the remaining complex classes for maps, masks

- check two sample H2 parsing and just make sure it works as you understand it


Read:
- Moments and 2-locus papers [goal: understanding of moments, of LD in history, of two-locus statistics] [check out 2-locus papers cited in Ragsdale 2019]
- F-statistic papers
- Papers about history (of course)
