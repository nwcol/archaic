MAIN GOALS

- clean up the likelihood function and develop good methods for estimation
    eg save bootstraps as 3d arrays or something

- write the wrapper for inference!

- make a class holding mutliple sample sets such that genome wide statistics can be computed from memory (if this works---- maybe too big to hold in memory)
    if this is possible, clean up the methods for computing and writing statistics to disk to avoid screwing around with so many .txts

- the fine r bin mesa

- look at divergence, etc to estimate split times

- keep improving the plot functions and trying to make them readable, pretty- reusable fxns

- really work out plot functions and make some nice recipes for pretty, readable plots (essentially publication quality)

-improve and document Bed class

-keep trying to understand the H_2 kick!
