various side goals

- clean up the functions for loading bootstraps etc. Might still be advisable to find a better way to save the bootstrap arrays but dont worry too much about it

- look at divergence, etc to estimate split times using one-locus stats and very simple models

- keep improving the plot functions and trying to make them readable, pretty- reusable fxns

-improve and document Bed class
