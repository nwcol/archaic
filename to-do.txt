primary goals

for getting pipeline hammered out for publication:
- script to make masks from vcfs
- exon masks and flank
- script to intersect and build restrictive masks


for getting CHTC running:

- edit parse script
- decide on final formats for output/bootstrap npzs
- edit bootstrap script
- edit infer scripts
- rebuild stats, bootstrap
- nice plotting fxns








- a real understanding of the statistic's dynamics!!!

- discriminating between structured and unstructured models
    using msprime, moments etc

- identifiability of coalescent rates; their covariance?

- piecewise but constant Ne to imitate long-term structure?

- analytically computing things like E[t_x t_y] and Cov(t_x, t_y)? [use McVean 2002, Wakeley as resources]


##

- really work out the plot functions/scripts and get automated plotting down nicely

- learn about expectations of H2 and write methods to compute it analytically

- learn about the relationship between LD, H2! Review definitions of statistics that measure LD

- Understand the two locus recursion system


Read:
- Markov chains, HMM
- Moments and 2-locus papers [goal: understanding of moments, of LD in history, of two-locus statistics] [check out 2-locus papers cited in Ragsdale 2019]
- Diffusion equations lol
- Wright papers (1931 etc)
- Tracts
- Haplotype sampling frequencies
- LD and inference
- F-statistic papers
- Papers about human history (of course)
