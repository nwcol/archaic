as of January 29. 

- keep learning how to use vim
- look into ipython or something
- clean up, document, improve modules, especially two_locus and one_locus
- documentation in general: write down what the scripts do etc
- clean up the remaining unchanged scripts

-> start working on visualizing .vcfs in the terminal and chopping chromosomes into blocks for analysis

- think about the indexing and make it easier to understand. its a very powerful tool
- finish setting up the UnphasedSampleSet structure and adjust everything to use it
- make a PhasedSampleSet class
- add functionality to slice chromosomes in UnphasedSampleSets into 5-10Mb regions for analysis

- figure out how to record all this analysis: think simple!!! make things streamlined, easy to understand


Order:

1. vcf_util
2. map_util, bed_util if they need changes (prob not major ones)
3. vcf_samples (maybe refactor name to sample_sets or something) 
4. one_locus and two_locus
5. the systems of input and output for the above and for coalescent simulations
