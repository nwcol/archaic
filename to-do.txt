primary goals

questions that can be asked about inference fxns:
    to what extent does convergence go to the same spot under the same intial parameters and other specifications?
    to what extent does optimization routine choice influence
        the speed of convergence
        the spot at which convergence occurs
    with different initial parameters, do we tend to converge to the same spot or to various local maxima?



X- investigate the effectiveness of some different optimization routines and settle on one

X- write out everything needed to run pairwise inference from the terminal (figure out how the output is going to look)

- add timing to the pairwise inference and find a way to automate time assignments for the archaic demes

- write a higher-level apparatus for doing and evaluating pairwise demogs in parallel with randomly generated initial parameters

- run a bunch of these

- find some way of summarizing across runs and pairs! work towards the construction of a general model.

- really work out the plot functions/scripts and get automated plotting down nicely

- make functions more verbose and nicer, like Aarons

- build a library of pre-parsed map/etc combinations!


- learn about expectations of H2 and write methods to compute it analytically

- write a fast optimization method

- check the optimization approximation stuff and make sure it runs properly

- go through the various parse functions and clean up, document, make sure things work

- check two sample H2 parsing and just make sure it works as you understand it

- relationship between LD, H2

various side goals

- think of smarter ways to process and save statistics. dont make huge leaps, but try to make things as clear and rational as possible

- clean up the functions for loading bootstraps etc. Might still be advisable to find a better way to save the bootstrap arrays but dont worry too much about it

- look at divergence, etc to estimate split times using one-locus stats and very simple models

- keep improving the plot functions and trying to make them readable, pretty- reusable fxns

-improve and document Bed class
